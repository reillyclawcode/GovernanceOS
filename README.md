# GovernanceOS

GovernanceOS is an open system for modeling, simulating, and operating civic governance programs. The first milestone is to provide a composable toolkit for charter authors, policy researchers, and operators to sketch institutions, publish charters, and run lightweight simulations.

## Repository Layout

- `docs/` — long-form briefs, governance playbooks, and working notes
- `packages/` (future) — core libraries for charters, ballots, and participation flows
- `apps/` (future) — reference UIs and CLI automation for operators

## Roadmap (v0)

1. Write the founding charter outline
2. Identify three governance modules (representation, finance, transparency)
3. Stand up a minimal API that can list modules and their configuration
4. Publish the first civic scenario walkthrough

## Getting Started

For now this repository only tracks documentation. Clone it, edit markdown, and open a PR. Implementation guides and automation tooling will follow once the charter solidifies.
