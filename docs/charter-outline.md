# GovernanceOS Charter Outline (Draft)

## Purpose
- Provide composable governance building blocks
- Prioritize transparency, auditability, and inclusive participation

## Pillars
1. **Representation** — delegate graph, participation quotas, recall tooling
2. **Finance** — treasury accounting, programmatic disbursements, on-chain attestations
3. **Civic UX** — ergonomic dashboards, civic identity, progressive disclosure

## Immediate Next Steps
- Interview civic program operators to validate module list
- Define data model for charters and policies
- Evaluate storage targets (Postgres vs. on-chain vs. hybrid)
